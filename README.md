# Linear-Regression-with-Scikit-Learn-Machine-Learning-with-Python
This Repo uses Linear Regression to train the model. The steps involved in doing this are:

1) A typical problem statement for machine learning
2) Downloading and exploring a dataset for machine learning
3) Linear regression with one variable using Scikit-learn
4) Linear regression with multiple variables
5) Using categorical features for machine learning
6) Regression coefficients and feature importance
7) Creating a training and testing set for reporting results
